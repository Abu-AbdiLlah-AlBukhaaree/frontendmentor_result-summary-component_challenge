## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Although most of the styles I applied in this project are things I'm used to before, I tasked myself to create re-usable styles for different parts of the project. I applied this mainly to the repeated colors.

### Continued development

Just as I mentioned above, I tasked myself with re-using styles, which I'm not used to before, I would like to use this technique in styling future projects. This is because this technique saves time and makes me avoid repetition of styles.
